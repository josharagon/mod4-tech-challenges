# Problem - Next Palindrome
Any number that reads the same way forwards as it does backwards is a palindrome. For instance, `12321` would be considered a palindrome, whereas `123` would not be. 

Write a function that takes in an integer and returns the next palindrome. For instance:

```js
findNextPalindrome(100)
// should return 101
```

and 

```js
findNextPalindrome(101)
// should return 111
```

## Rewrite the question in your own words:

Find the next number that is a palindrome after a given number (param)

## What assumptions will you make about this problem if you cannot ask any more clarifying questions? What are your reasons for making those assumptions?

I will solve this in the easiest way first even if it not the fastest optimized way. Then go back and refactor with extra time.

If number is equal to opposite return num else ++
